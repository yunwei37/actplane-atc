## Template

The ACM direct template URL returned HTTP 403 from this environment, so the ACM
`acmart` package was downloaded from CTAN, which ACM and SIGPLAN list as an
accepted distribution channel:

- Downloaded archive: `vendor/acmart-ctan.zip`
- Generated local class: `acmart.cls`
- Local bibliography style: `ACM-Reference-Format.bst`

The draft uses the local class/style files so it can build without requiring a
system-wide `acmart` installation.

The CTAN archive was extracted only to generate the local class/style files; the
expanded template tree is not kept in the repository. Build PDFs are tracked,
while LaTeX scratch files are ignored by `docs/paper/.gitignore`.

The draft follows the CFP's `sigplan,10pt` setup and keeps page numbers enabled
with `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`.

## Build

```bash
cd docs/paper
make
make abstract
make clean
```

Outputs:

- `main.pdf`: full paper draft.
- `extended-abstract.pdf`: two-page extended abstract draft.

## Draft Status

RQ1 currently contains the latest six-family trace-conditioned compliance
snapshot. RQ2/RQ3 result slots should remain `TBD` until those experiments have
been run and their artifacts are recorded.
